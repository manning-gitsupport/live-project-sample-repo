This is a starting file for liveProject XYZ. This project contains four milestones:

1. Getting started
2. Making progress
3. Nearly there
4. Wrapping it up

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to create a new branch from main to store your work for the first milestone. Click the button that says **main** and enter a name for your milestone one branch. We suggest "milestone-1". It's not fancy, but it's clear. Then click *create branch milestone-1 from main** to create your new branch.
