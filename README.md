## About this sample project-specific repository

This liveProject sample project-specific repository shows the usage of branches and tags to organize and share your project deliverables. These are not rules but are guidelines for you to adapt to your workflow and requirements. Explore the structure of the repository and think what would be effective for your work.

If you are a beginner to GitHub, you can use GitHub's [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) Quickstart to learn the basics. To use your liveProject project-specific repository, you should know how to:

* [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#create-a-branch)
* [add or edit files and commit to the branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#making-and-committing-changes)
* [use a pull request to merge changes from a branch back into main](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#opening-a-pull-request)


## GitHub integration FAQs

### **Can I submit from a repo I create in my own personal GitHub account?**
No. You will receive an invitation to collaborate in a project-specific repo hosted by Manning. Only a link from this repo will be accepted in the **Submit Your Work** section of each milestone. 

### **Can I fork the Manning-hosted, project-specific repo and work in it instead?**
Yes. However, you will need to upload the solution from your fork into the project-specific repo, as only a link to the project-specific repository will be accepted. Then you can share your solution in the milestone's **Submit Your Work section**. You can also clone the repository to your local machine and work with it in GitHub Desktop and your preferred code editor.

### **If I want to work in another site, such as Google Colab, how can I share my solutions?**
You will need to download your solution from the other repo site and then upload it into the project-specific repo. Then you can share your solution in the milestone's **Submit Your Work** section.

### **How do I know if there are patches for the project I’m working on in GitHub?**
You can set up GitHub notifications so you are alerted if a new patch is pushed to your repo. When you are on the liveProject platform, viewing one of the **Submit Your Work** sections, click **go to your repository**. Click **Settings** then click **Notifications** in the left column to set up email notifications for changes to this repo. 

### **Can I see other learners’ submissions?**
Yes. After you share the link to your milestone solution, you will have the option to see others’ submissions. 

1. Click on the button, **see others’ submissions**. This will open a list of users who have already submitted. 
2. Click on the key icon next to the person’s link. This will generate an automatic email inviting you to that learner’s solution. You will have seven days to accept the invitation.

You will have view-only access to others' submissions.

### **I don't want to share my deliverable with other learners. How can I prevent this?**
There is a checkbox in each milestone's Submit Your Work section that says, "Share my work." Clear this box if you **do not** want to share your work with others. You can change this decision later at any time.
