_This file has been altered from the original in milestone-1 and renamed to **milestone-2 work**. You may need to edit existing files or add new files to the branch to complete the work in the milestone._

_Once you complete the work, you can create a new branch to store your work in the next milestone 3._

In this file, the text from the original file in milestone 2 has been changed to italics, new text added, and the file name changed to milestone-3 work. Your files and work will be unique to the project. These are just samples to track the movement of files through the branches.
